# ACCELERATING-VACCINE-DEVELOPMENT
## OVERVIEW:
Moderna, a leading biotechnology company, specializes in drug discovery and development. To support its large-scale data processing and computational needs, it requires a scalable and efficient cloud infrastructure. Traditional methods of data handling and simulations in vaccine development are slow and resource-intensive, delaying research, testing, and production. Implementing advanced cloud solutions can help accelerate the process, ensuring faster vaccine development, especially in times of global health emergencies.
