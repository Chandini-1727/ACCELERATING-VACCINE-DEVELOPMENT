# ACCELERATING-VACCINE-DEVELOPMENT
## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Moderna is a global bio technology company which focuses on drug discovery and development. it requires a robust and scalable cloud infrastructure to mange massive data requirements and computations needs. The traditional methods of data processing and simulation in vaccine development are time-consuming and resource-intensive. This hinders the speed at which vaccines can be researched, tested, and brought to market, especially during a global health crisis.
